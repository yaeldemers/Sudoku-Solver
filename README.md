# Sudoku-Solver
This is a python implementation of a sudoku solver using Jupyter Notebook

Backtracking is the algorithm used to solve any 9x9 sudoku puzzle in this project.
You can see how the algorithm was implemented by heading over to the "sudoku_solver.ipynb" file in the repository. 

This algorithm solves any 9x9 puzzles, but note that if a sudoku would have more than one possible set of solution,
it would only display one possible completed sudoku. 

If you wish to play around with this algorithm, simply clone this repo, or download the "sudoku_solver.ipynb" file, 
and run the python notebook in Jupyter.
